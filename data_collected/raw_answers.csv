We'll see. Statement of purpose focused on MicroMasters performance, application of MM to current job, what I want to learn and probably Ph.D in, and why my undergrad GPA sucks. I decided to take a different angle from the statement for my rejected application, in addition to the MM classes.

Created some projects using K-Means and XGBoost. Nothing mind blowing though compared to what other companies are doing.

Recommendations: 3; my immediate supervisor, a former work colleague, and a statistics professor that I had when I was back in college

Comments: As you might have read, I do not have a STEM background. Just fell into analytics and taught myself on the basic concepts of it really. I'm brushing up on my math before the year ends. I really thought I won't make the cut when I lurked the credentials of those who got accepted for the Fall 2018 cohort. I'm really sure other guys here are way more qualified than I am.

Education: Top 35 State School - triple majored graduated with 2 BS

* BS Finance (Majors in Finance & Entrepreneurship)
* BS Management Info Systems 
* Overall GPA 3.49, upwards trend with 3.8+ Major GPA for Finance and MIS

Test Scores: Taking GMAT in less than a month for far in the future MBA but don't plan to put it on this application unless I somehow get a really great score

Experience: Just graduated, landed an ERP Implementation Consulting Job and will be working that for about a year at matriculation. 2 months as a corporate financial analyst intern at a medium sized ($50 million) company

Recommendations: (Applied for another program that I turned down and am confident I can use them again)

* Exec. VP/ Mentor of where I had internship 
* Business Professor/ Mentor
* MIS Professor

Comments: Main concerns:

* ERP implementation doesn't really touch on analytics and since I have yet to start I can't say I'll be able to bring what I learn into my job
* I want this degree for switching careers into a data analysis driven consulting  or data scientist position, I don't see myself in ERP implementations forever but for the short term I do think it's a great fit. 
* Want this to beef up my application for when I apply to competitive MBA programs in the future, would it be unwise to mention this in my SOP?
* I guess my main concern is the lack of WE and being in a non relevant position to analytics. I loved the analytics based classes in my MIS major and really see myself doing that down the road. As long as I align it with my career goals in my SOP then should I be in the clear?

Comments: This is my first time applying for any graduate program, so I'm super excited but also anxious because I feel like my credentials are not that competitive. I work with data scientists frequently and have a pretty topical/high level understanding of the course material but lack a strong math background. The highest math I've taken is half a semester of Calc II. For career goals, I'm hoping to get more into the data science aspect of my job and maybe transition over eventually (that seems to be a common career path at my company, work as a developer in data analytics then move to data science). Regardless of accept/deny, I'm planning on enrolling in one of the edx courses that opens in May. Just excited all around! Probably sounds cheesy but I'm just incredibly thankful I even have the opportunity to apply, since my company offers tuition assistance.

Experience: None! I have no professional experience in this field i.e. no job and no employer. This is what I was afraid would hold me back. So I recognized this and went with a functional resume that highlighted projects instead. I briefly mentioned my career (I'm a teacher and owner of a small press) in my bio, but I didn't make it stand out on my resume. Instead, I listed 3 major analytics projects I've worked on in my spare time. Two were centered around mining twitter data and analyzing it with Tableau, the other was focused purely on a statistical analysis that I did while on a research scholarship in Japan.

Recommendations: 3, two from former professors (both were thesis advisors), one from a mentor

Comments: Here to add a data point. I didn't think I had nearly as many qualifications as some of the other applicants I see here, so I'm a bit surprised that they took me! However I think I may have had a unique selling point that swayed them (it was either that or those independent research projects), so I wanted to post my stats as an example of the possibilities if nothing else."

I would like to think my SOP was a powerful display of my motivation and desire to work in this field. I also think the program is looking for people who not only know programming/stat/math, but also can accurately convey the data into insights.  Being that most of my career is in customer-facing roles and selling engineered solutions, I think this was a strong point on my application as well as it demonstrates that I have successfully conveyed complex ideas/solutions to less well-informed people/customers/colleagues.

Recommendations: 1 UIC graduate program director, 1 former manager, 1 colleague

Comments: I think the strongest part of my application is my work experience (nearly all healthcare analytics and technology) and the fact that I already have an MS (apparently last year's cohort, 80%+ already had Masters degrees?).  Although my graduate GPA was a 3.8/4.0, I am concerned about my undergrad GPA being 3.0/4.0. Hopefully GA Tech admissions will take into account that I have balanced work and online school previously.
 Additionally I am a bit concerned about my job-hopping, to the point where I explicitly addressed it in my SOP.  Basically I was doing some soul searching and came to the conclusion that I truly am passionate about analytics in healthcare, and that I want to become a leader in the field.  Stated the reason why I chose GA Tech program (I did not apply to any other schools) was reputation, hometown location for me (even though the program is virtual), the fact the program is entirely online and that I have done that before, and the potential ROI given low cost.  My SOP could have been better, but I was trying to be as succinct as possible.  I pointed out the fact that this program would be a great supplement to the type of work that I do (which is 100% true, given that actuarial science and healthcare are data-heavy fields with lots of statistics and analytics components).  I have taken two GA Tech Coursera (MOOC) classes with Professor Braunstein which I didn't point out, but it is on my resume.  I am also certified in Tableau Desktop 10 (Qualified Associate).  Overall I thought the online application process was great!  I wish they had this years ago when I was younger in school."

Decision Date: 05/03/2018

Education: Texas A&M University, BS Mechanical Engineering, GPA: 3.86

Test Scores: N/A 

Experience: 1 year, Telecommunication Infrastructure Industry. My current role is in network inventory management and design. I've used Python to automate some processes, along with data quality management. 

Recommendations: 3 (current manager, 2 professors)

Comments: I am hoping to change my career towards data science. During my undergrad, I did a decent amount of optimization problems using Matlab, and have since taken a couple MOOCs on programming and machine learning. I have a pretty solid math background through differential equations and linear algebra, and so I fill a lot of my time with programming to make up for my lack of formal training. Update: Excited that I got in! It's hard to say for sure, but I am thinking that my undergrad GPA along with strong recommendations helped pull me through. In my SOP, I focused on my drive for career change, motivation to learn as much as I can on my own time (mentioned Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course that I completed on Coursera), and pretty detailed career plans. 

SIDE NOTE:
I would love to hear thoughts on track selection. My end goal is becoming a Data Scientist, and I am leaning toward the ""Analytical Tools"" track, since it seems to be in line with my career goals. I had previously planned on the ""Computational Data Analytics"" track, so I'm considering that as an option as well. Thoughts? 
Also, how does the track decision work? Is it something that needs to be stated and confirmed prior to beginning the program, or can that be decided along the way?

I'm based out of Denver, so I'd love to connect with any other Coloradans in the Fall 2018 program."

I think my statement of purpose and recommendations also were decisive factors. I will be taking the rest of the year to prepare.

I moved to the consultant position following a project where I redefined a human capital allocation process that was slated to be discontinued and is now used by our CIO. In my consulting position it was my job to identify and pursue analytics initiatives while imbedded within functional and process teams. I accepted the Security Analyst Position within the last quarter, but I will be focused on identifying internal & external security vulnerabilities, analyzing usage, and identifying sustainable & efficient process improvements for our ERP. I also won a company-wide competition to solve an optimization problem, received an award from our CIO for innovative contributions leading to significant revenue generation and cost reduction, and have sat on the panel for multiple data science/analytics roadshows and Q&A sessions within the company. Additionally, I am a college recruiter and develop analytics case studies for college professors. 


My application might sound strong, but after reading the other application overviews posted here, I suddenly feel a dime a dozen. Hopefully my limited work experience and undergrad GPA don't hurt me (spent 2.5 years in architecture, before BSBA where major GPA was 3.7).

Recommendations: 1 from co-founder of current start up, 1 from former manager, 1 from instructor of an intro to data science class I took

Comments: I got rejected from the Fall cohort and decided to apply again by taking the GRE, taking a data science introductory course, and using that instructor as my last recommendation instead of a former colleague. Probably the biggest change between the two applications is that my current role is in data science, and not in marketing analytics.

I actually received the acceptance email about a minute before receiving the ""Decision Available"" email, which gave me a laugh. Applyweb hasn't updated beyond ""Dept. Decision Made"" but I think that will change EOD today.

I now have to choose between this program and the MIDS program at UC Berkeley, which I also got accepted into. GT is much easier on the wallet, but I'm already a grad from them. UC Berkeley, for how much it costs, may be a good way to show that I'm more well-rounded educationally. I don't know which one to pick :/"

Glad the application committee (I presume) dug into my cv/letters/sop a bit and found me qualified. Choosing to pursue this degree instead of going back for a PhD which I've also considered as it will let me continue to work full time while studying (a real paycheck is addicting). Wrote in my statement of purpose how the types of questions natural resource scientists are asking are increasingly similar to big-data problems in business and IT, and how future scientific teams will also require experts in analytics-based approaches. I also like the idea of broadening my marketable skills should I ever need to find a job outside of what is a rather niche area of expertise."

But I decided to post so that anyone looking at this thinking that they can't do the program if they haven't already been a data analyst or something like that might be encouraged to try. Obviously my personal statement was important to establish my love of math and analytics, and why I studied law instead of analytics in the first place, and what I did to pursue my math and CS interests in the meantime.

**Comments:**

After reading through this thread I'm surprised I got in for Fall 2017. I don't have the strongest quant background (doing some major brushing up on calc, linear algebra, stats) but I guess a good base for the program. If I had to guess I would say my letters of rec were good and I think my letter of intent was probably good. Not sure if I'll start in the Fall or try to defer to spring yet. "
